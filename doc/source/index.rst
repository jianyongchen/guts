Welcome to GUTS, Virtual Machine's migration into OpenStack as a Service

Guts is a OpenStack supplementary project which helps us to migrate VMs from existing
cloud to OpenStack cloud.

This document describes Guts for contributors of the project, and assumes
that you are already familiar with OpenStack from an `end-user perspective`_.

.. _`end-user perspective`: http://docs.openstack.org/
